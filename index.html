            Satoshi Tajiri is a Japanese video game designer and director best known as the creator of Nintendo's Pok√©mon franchise and one of the founders, and President of video game developer Game Freak. A fan of arcade games, Tajiri wrote for and edited his own video gaming fanzine Game Freak with Ken Sugimori, before evolving it into a development company of the same name. Tajiri claims that the joining of two Game Boys via a link cable inspired him to create a game which embodied the collection and companionship of his childhood hobby, insect collecting. The game, which became Pok√©mon Red and Pok√©mon Green, took six years to complete and went on to spark a multibillion-dollar franchise which reinvigorated Nintendo's handheld gaming. Tajiri continued to work as director for the Pok√©mon series until the development of Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire, when he changed his role to executive producer.

Tajiri has also worked for other projects including Mario spin-offs. He was also an executive producer on the live-action film Detective Pikachu.
